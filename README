NB:  this was a project for me to scratch my c++ itch and isn't intented
     for any sort of production use. 

tinymq is a message queueing server designed for simplicity and (eventually) 
reliability and performance.

notable features:
  - persistent mmap()-based backing store for message durability
  - no complex message format - messages are simple binary blobs
  - simple api : put(message), get(), and ack(message_id)
  - each tinymq instance manages only one queue
